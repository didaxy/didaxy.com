!!Summary

Previously, I wrote [[some notes on React|Let's Learn React]] and now I'd like to take a deeper dive through the documentation.

The reason I think this is the best way to learn about React is that the framework has changed quite a lot over time and 'best practise' is not always reflected in the highest ranked tutorials for particular topics when searching for information.
