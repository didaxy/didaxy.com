On the plus side, you will always control the email address - you will be able to switch to using a different email host whenever you want and take the same email address with you. You'll also be able to have unlimited different email addresses, though depending on the provider you choose, you may have to pay a little extra.</p><p>On the negative side, in addition to possible charges, you will need to keep up ownership of your domain in order to keep receiving email at that address. If you don't renew your domain ownership, email sent to the address will start to bounce, which can be annoying for anyone trying to contact you. Make sure it's a domain you like and are prepared to keep up in the future. </p></div>
